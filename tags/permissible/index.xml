It did however state if your CV contains &lt;strong>any&lt;/strong> personal details your application may be withdrawn. Assuming you were genuinely interested in the job, this is not something that you want to get wrong!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think we can all agree that we all like to be treated fairly, and would like to think we were hired for a new job based on the merits of our skills and experience rather than gender, age, race, or ethnicity etc. so I wholly support a redacted CV screening process to remove reviewer bias.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
