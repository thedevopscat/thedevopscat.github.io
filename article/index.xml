      <title>What Info is Permissible on a Redacted CV?</title>

      <description>I recently saw a job advertised where the application process required a redacted CV, but didn&amp;rsquo;t go as far to say what information was permissible. It did however state if your CV contains any personal details your application may be withdrawn. Assuming you were genuinely interested in the job, this is not something that you want to get wrong!
I think we can all agree that we all like to be treated fairly, and would like to think we were hired for a new job based on the merits of our skills and experience rather than gender, age, race, or ethnicity etc.</description>

      <description>Having just completed the setup of algolia search on this site I felt compelled to write a new post and let you know my experience, as it may save you some time! Suffice to say, the potentially difficult part was easy, and the easy part was hard! This may be down to the combination of my (feature rich) Bilberry theme and Hugo, so if you choose this combination, This may be of particular interest.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About this time of year, I start to feel reflective on the years achievements, the road is
not always smooth and as a driven technical professional progress can seem quite pedestrian
in its pace.  Itâ€™s very easy to forget how much ground has been covered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
